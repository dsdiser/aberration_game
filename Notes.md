# Aberration Notes
### Deadline:  March 14th 2024 at 2:59 AM

## General Ideas


Top down tank game, the "aberrations" are modifiers to the tank that can harm you/make things more difficult.
Examples:
- A gun barrel pointed to the side that shoots bullets to the side
- A random bullet type that recoils you further than normal

These can be gained how? By beating levels maybe? So by the final level you have a large amount of barriers to success. 

Design ideas:
- Dying means going back a level and losing your last aberration?

Don't forget!
- Music
- Sound effects
- Lighting
